# Google Imitation

View Project: https://zsrobinson.github.io/google/

This is a small project I made to try to replicate the look and feel of the Google search engine, but using a local database of websites. It's not intended as a replacement for Google in any means. However, I created this for a project we will do next school year in my Cisco Certification class where we will build a network and host websites, so I created this as a way to search through all of the websites our class creates. Even if we don't end up using this, I still think it was a good exercise in using Flexbox in CSS and more advanced uses of dictionaries and arrays in JavaScript. The sample database included with this project (sites.json) is just some random sites I thought of off the top of my head to test it, but any sites could be in that database with the same format to customize it. In the future, I may add a section for key words in the database to help the search find websites, as well as a dark mode. I am also thinking about adding a Google Maps section where it displays each site as a geographical location, as for our school project each website will be a different city across the world. Thanks for getting this far into my explanation and showing interest in it :)
